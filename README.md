# Natural Language Processing

This project is an example of NLP on Tripadvisor hotel reviews with ratings from 1 to 5.  The data is pretty clean (there's more data cleaning in my descriptive MLR project so far), but I prep the data corpus 
using typical methods such as getting rid of characters, stopwords, and stemming each word.  I leave most negative words in the data because "I will definitely come back" has a far different connotation than 
"I will definitely not come back," in terms of sentiment analysis.

I wrote functions to compare multiple word counts for the bag of words sparse matrix, using **Random Forest** with varying numbers of trees and a couple different criteria, and also compared **XGBoost**, both in terms 
of model accuracy and runtime, so there's some model selection there, as well as k-fold cross-validation to make sure we're not being too optimistic.

The best model I came up with was XGBoost using a 750-word bag of words, which got about a 59% accuracy rate.  Pure guessing would have gotten about a 20% accuracy, and knowing that 5-star reviews were 44% of 
the total reviews would have gotten a 44% accuracy by just guessing 5s, so 59% is decent for this model, especially given the ambiguity of reviews vs ratings.  I would definitely like to improve the percentage.
